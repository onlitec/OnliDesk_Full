# Epic 1: Core Remote Access Platform

## Overview
This epic covers the foundational remote access capabilities that form the core of the Onlidesk MVP.

## Stories (Development Order)

### Story 1.1: Remote Access Foundation
**Priority**: High  
**Complexity**: High  
**Dependencies**: None  

**As a** support technician, **I want** to request remote access to a client's machine, **so that** I can diagnose and solve technical problems.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The technician must be able to start a session from the Technician Portal, using the client's ID
- The client must receive a request and have the option to accept or reject it
- The system must support actions that require elevated privileges (administrator access)
- The client must be able to end the session at any time

### Story 1.2: Secure File Transfer
**Priority**: High  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Dependencies**: Story 1.1  

**As a** support technician, **I want** to be able to send and receive files during a remote access session, **so that** I can install software or transfer documents.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The technician must have a visual interface to browse the client's files
- File transfers must be secure and encrypted
- The client must receive a visual notification about the transfers
- The client must have the option to cancel a transfer at any time

### Story 1.3: Unattended Access
**Priority**: Medium  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Dependencies**: Story 1.1  

**As a** support technician, **I want** to be able to access a computer without the user being present, **so that** I can perform scheduled maintenance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The access must be configured by the client and protected by a secure password
- The password must be configurable, and the client must be able to deactivate the access at any time
