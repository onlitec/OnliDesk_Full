Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Onlidesk
1. Introduction
Onlidesk is a cross-platform remote access solution developed to optimize technical support. The goal is to provide a secure and efficient tool that allows support technicians to remotely access client computers to diagnose and solve technical problems.

2. Product Goals and Objectives
Main Goal: To develop an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) with remote access and file transfer functionalities, compatible with major operating systems.

Security: Ensure that all sessions and data transfers are end-to-end encrypted.

Usability: Offer an intuitive interface for both the client and the technician.

Performance: Provide a low-latency experience for screen sharing and control.

3. Target Audience
Support Technicians: Professionals who need a reliable tool to provide remote assistance.

End-Clients: Users who need technical help and require a secure way to connect with a technician.

4. Project Scope (MVP)
The Onlidesk MVP will include the following functionalities:

Remote access for screen viewing and control.

Secure file transfer.

Unattended access.

Compatibility with Windows, Linux, and macOS.

5. User Stories and Acceptance Criteria
Story 1: Remote Access

As a support technician, I want to request remote access to a client's machine, so that I can diagnose and solve technical problems.

Acceptance Criteria:

The technician must be able to start a session from the Technician Portal, using the client's ID.

The client must receive a request and have the option to accept or reject it.

The system must support actions that require elevated privileges (administrator access).

The client must be able to end the session at any time.

Story 2: File Transfer

As a support technician, I want to be able to send and receive files during a remote access session, so that I can install software or transfer documents.

Acceptance Criteria:

The technician must have a visual interface to browse the client's files.

File transfers must be secure and encrypted.

The client must receive a visual notification about the transfers.

The client must have the option to cancel a transfer at any time.

Story 3: Unattended Access

As a support technician, I want to be able to access a computer without the user being present, so that I can perform scheduled maintenance.

Acceptance Criteria:

The access must be configured by the client and protected by a secure password.

The password must be configurable, and the client must be able to deactivate the access at any time.

6. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: Screen transmission latency must not exceed 200 ms under stable network conditions.

Security: All communication must use end-to-end encryption (TLS/SSL).

Compatibility: The client must function on Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems.

Scalability: The server architecture must be capable of supporting a 500% increase in the number of concurrent sessions.
