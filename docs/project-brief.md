Project Brief - Onlidesk
1. Project Name
Onlidesk

2. Project Overview
Onlidesk is a cross-platform remote access solution designed to provide efficient and secure technical support. The project aims to develop a robust tool that allows support technicians to connect to client computers from anywhere, diagnose problems, and perform necessary tasks without needing to be physically present.

3. Problem Statement
The current methods for providing technical support are often inefficient, requiring either physical presence or using fragmented and insecure tools. This leads to wasted time for both technicians and clients, increased costs, and potential security risks.

4. Solution
Onlidesk will provide a unified platform with a secure, low-latency connection. The system will consist of a lightweight client application and a web-based portal for technicians, ensuring a seamless and reliable support experience.

5. Target Audience
Support Technicians: Professionals in IT and tech support who need a fast, reliable, and secure tool for remote assistance.

End-Clients: Individuals and businesses who require technical support and want a simple, secure way to grant access to a trusted technician.

6. Key Features (MVP)
The Minimum Viable Product will focus on the core functionalities essential for effective remote support:

Remote Access: Technicians can view and control a client's screen in real-time.

File Transfer: Securely send and receive files between the technician and the client.

Unattended Access: The ability to configure password-protected access for performing maintenance tasks without the client being present.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: The client application will be available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

7. Goals and Success Metrics
Launch: Successfully launch the MVP within the planned timeline.

User Adoption: Achieve a defined number of active technicians and clients within the first three months.

Performance: Maintain an average screen sharing latency of under 200ms.

Security: Pass a security audit and ensure all data is protected with end-to-end encryption.

8. Technical Stack
Client: Qt/C++ for native cross-platform performance.

Server: Go (Golang) for high-concurrency and real-time communication.

Technician Portal: React and Node.js for a modern, responsive web interface.

Deployment: Docker and a Linux VPS for scalable and consistent deployment.
