# Story 1.2: Secure File Transfer

## Status
In Progress

## Story
**As a** support technician,
**I want** to securely transfer files to and from the client's machine during a remote session,
**so that** I can provide comprehensive technical support by uploading diagnostic tools, patches, or retrieving log files without compromising security.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The technician can initiate file transfers (upload/download) through the Technician Portal during an active session
2. File transfers are encrypted end-to-end using the same security protocols as the remote session
3. The client receives a notification and can approve/deny each file transfer request
4. Transfer progress is displayed in real-time for both technician and client
5. File integrity is verified using checksums after transfer completion
6. Transfer history is logged for audit purposes
7. File size limits and allowed file types can be configured
8. Transfers can be paused, resumed, or cancelled by either party
9. Multiple files can be transferred simultaneously with queue management
10. The system handles network interruptions gracefully with automatic retry mechanisms

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story builds upon the Remote Access Foundation (Story 1.1) by adding secure file transfer capabilities to the existing session management system. The file transfer feature integrates with all three core components while maintaining the established security and communication patterns.

### Core Components Involved

**Cross-Platform Client (Qt/C++)**
- Function: Handle file transfer requests, manage local file operations, display transfer progress
- Technology: Qt Framework provides native file dialogs and cross-platform file system access
- Integration: Extends existing WebSocket connection for file transfer protocol

**Connection Server (Go)**
- Function: Route encrypted file data between client and technician, manage transfer sessions, handle authentication
- Technology: Go's goroutines ideal for concurrent file streaming, WebSocket protocol extension
- Integration: Builds on existing session management and encryption infrastructure

**Technician Portal (React/Node.js)**
- Function: Provide file transfer interface, manage upload/download requests, display transfer status
- Technology: React for UI components, Node.js backend for file handling
- Integration: Extends existing portal session interface

### Communication Flow for File Transfers
1. Technician initiates file transfer request through Portal
2. Portal sends transfer request to Connection Server via WebSocket
3. Server forwards request to Client with transfer metadata
4. Client displays approval dialog to user
5. Upon approval, encrypted file streaming begins through Server proxy
6. Real-time progress updates sent to both Portal and Client
7. Transfer completion verified with checksum validation
8. Transfer logged for audit purposes

### Technical Requirements

**File Transfer Protocol**
- Extend existing WebSocket message types for file operations
- Implement chunked transfer for large files (recommended 64KB chunks)
- Use binary WebSocket frames for file data transmission
- Maintain separate control channel for transfer management

**Security Implementation**
- Leverage existing TLS/SSL encryption for transport security
- Implement additional file-level encryption for sensitive data
- Use SHA-256 checksums for integrity verification
- Secure temporary file storage with proper cleanup

**Performance Considerations**
- Target transfer speeds: 10MB/s minimum on broadband connections
- Support concurrent transfers (max 5 simultaneous)
- Implement transfer rate limiting to prevent bandwidth saturation
- Memory-efficient streaming to handle large files

**Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- File path handling for Windows, Linux, and macOS
- Unicode filename support
- Proper file permissions and access control
- Platform-specific file system limitations

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Go WebSocket extensions, file streaming libraries
- **Client**: Qt file dialogs, progress widgets, file I/O operations
- **Frontend**: React file upload components, progress indicators
- **Security**: TLS/SSL, SHA-256 hashing, AES encryption
- **Testing**: Cross-platform file transfer validation

```

### Security Considerations
- File type validation to prevent malicious uploads
- Virus scanning integration points
- Audit logging for compliance requirements
- Secure file deletion after transfer completion
- Access control based on technician permissions

### Dependencies on Story 1.1
- Session management infrastructure
- WebSocket communication protocol
- End-to-end encryption framework
- Client-server authentication
- Technician portal session interface

## Testing

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: File transfer protocol, encryption/decryption, checksum validation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end file transfer scenarios, cross-platform compatibility
- **Security Tests**: Encryption verification, file integrity, access control
- **Performance Tests**: Large file transfers, concurrent operations, network conditions
- **UI Tests**: File selection, progress display, error handling

- Client tests: `tests/client/file_transfer/`
- Server tests: `tests/server/file_transfer/`
- Portal tests: `tests/portal/components/FileTransfer/`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/file_transfer/`

### Testing Standards
