### Architecture Overview

The Onlidesk architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and secure. The system is divided into three main components: the cross-platform client, the connection server, and the technician portal. They communicate securely, with the server acting as a central hub for all sessions, ensuring an efficient and reliable data flow.
